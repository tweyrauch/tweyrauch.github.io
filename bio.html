<h2>Master of Science: Communication Studies</h2>

<p>I am currently working on my Master of Science in Communications degree, focusing on Technological Communications, at Eastern Washington University. While my major is Communication Studies my focus is Technological Communications, which means I am particularly focused on communication through graphic and web design. I also have a Bachelor of Arts in English, with an emphasis on <a href="http://admission.wsu.edu/academics/fos/Public/field.castle?id=1605" class="intext">Professional Writing and Rhetoric</a>, from Washington State University. <span>Go Cougs!</span></p>

<h2>Background Information</h2>

<p>I was born and raised in Spokane, WA where we are lucky enough to experience four seasons of weather (something I particularly enjoy due to my love of skiing and the snow). I attended Contract Based Education for high school which I completed in 3 years, with the added benefit of 2 years of Running Start through the Spokane Community College. As mentioned above I was lucky enough to receive my Bachelor of Arts degree in Pullman. While at WSU I also joined the Up All Night Committee of the <a href="http://studentinvolvement.orgsync.com/org/studententertainmentboard" class="intext">Student Entertainment Board</a> and had the opportunity to participate in the organization and the carrying out of the monthly Up All Night event.</p>


<h2>Additional Information</h2>

<p>For the past 9 years I have volunteered for the organization <a href="http://partnersforpets.org/" class="intext">Partners for Pets</a>, and continue to do so. Partners for Pets is an animal rescue group which rescues animals, primarily cats, from the euthanasia lists of local shelters and keeps them until adopted. My position as lead volunteer allows me to oversee other volunteers while allowing me the enjoyment of working for a worthy cause and the fun work of socializing the cats in the store.</p>

<p>I have also had the opportunity to assist  a local artist and friend with her website <a href="http://melindamelvinarts.com/" class="intext">Melinda Melvin Arts</a>.</p>

<h2>Professional Objectives</h2>

<p>Right now, my main goal is to find a summer internship which would allow practice and development of skills in graphic, layout and/or website design. Eventually, I would hope I can find a position which would require skills in graphic, layout, and/or website design.</p>
